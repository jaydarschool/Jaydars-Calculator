        hey guys, your possibly local coding nerd, jaydar here
        this time, i tried to make a calculator, granted it's very basic
        anyways, i started working on this to dip my toes into forms w/ DOM JS, by using many types of form inputs in one page, and then using them meaningfully, by calculating what you inputted.

            PATCH NOTES:
        
        V1.0 (4-27-2022): The broken, pointless, and buggy, original version
        
        V2.0 (5-2-2022): A huge update that actually made the calculator functional and stuff
        
        V2.1 (5-3-2022): A smaller update that added Problem History and a button to clear the problem displayed (no clear history button, cuz I'm too lazy).
