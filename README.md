# Jaydars-Calculator
Jaydar's Calculator is my basic, crappy calculator. It can add, subtract, multiply, or divide nearly any 2 numbers.

## Why did you make this?

- To show off how cool and smart I am, with my HTML, CSS, and DOM JS knowledge.
- To dip my toes into forms with DOM.
- And, for a coder, what would better to work on than a project that uses math?

# Features and notes

## Features:
- As stated before, it can add, subtract, multiply, or divide nearly any 2 numbers.
- It has some code that stops you from making errors, such as stopping you from using 0 in division problems.
- It has problem history, which displays every problem calculated in this current session.

## Notes:
- Just because I made a calculator, it doesn't mean I condone or encourage cheating in Math class.
- Just like with FCC: DE on GitHub, there will most likely be formatting errors and stuff.
  - Also like FCC: DE, the code is split up into different files.
